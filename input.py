#Let's assume we want to take the age of the user as input.
#We know that the input() function returns a string.
#To convert it to a number, we can use the int() function:

age=int(input())
print(age)

age1=42
print("The age is:"+str(age1))

#Simple Calculator

#10

x=input()
y=input()
res=int(x)+int(y)
print(res)
